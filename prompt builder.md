Task 1: Build Different Presets for the 4 different tracks

Prompt presets to include details on:-
- Purpose
- Era & Capture
- Production Design
- Lighting
- Wardrobe and Styling (Joan)
- Performance & Camera
- Editorial & Effect
- Finish
- Vibe

Presets should always include "do not write text on the image"


Task 2: Image Prompting Outline

Keep in mind we’re going to get a ton of shots, so we shouldn’t limit ourselves entirely to strict structures. We’re giving ourselves a broad outline and accepting the fact that, throughout the editing and animating process, I’ll be combining a wide variety of material into the finished product. The goal isn’t just to capture the shots we think will specifically be in the music video, but to create a massive repository of images that cover what we need, what we think we might need, and even what we might not need at all.

Create a 10 section outline now. Don’t focus on specific shots—instead, think of it as a loose, high-level structure that we can draw upon to help guide us as we explore all the possible images within that overall section.No need to mention the aspect ratio, this is already decided.We are aiming to create a visual library based on shot types. So let’s first build this outline with the correct, proven structure. Following the structure of the song lyrics but not too strictly.

Group sections by their function: The Narrative Core, The Music Video Spectacle, and The Emotional/Thematic Deep Cuts. This will give us the massive, varied repository of images we need for a dynamic and powerful edit.Bear in mind that generally we only want to have 1 to 3 characters appear on screen at a single time. the reason for this is once we begin to go past that the quality of the characters in images decreases. 


Task 3: Image Prompts

Every prompt will need location information as well as character information

Closeups on single characters create the best portrayal, and then having 2 characters shown in closeups is fantastic, medium closeups are good too, but once we get to medium shots it begins to worsen. this means having a whole section dedicated to lots of characters is counterintuitive. Other than opening scenes showing location every single shot should contain at least one character.

In the prompt, when using named characters that have an associated actor, write like this "A Joan of Arc character with features similar to Zendaya..." or "A young woman inspired by Zendaya as Joan of Arc...".
See the characters doc for details on these.

Begin each prompt with the shot type in capitals (e.g. MEDIUM SHOT, EXTREME CLOSE-UP, WIDE ANGLE SHOT). Try to mix up the shot types amongst the prompts.

Prompts should avoid sexual imagery and that of overt terror, especially when children are involved. 
See the SORA image generation doc attached.

Prompts should be around 200 words long and for each one I would need to see:
- The ID of the prompt
- A list of characters mentioned in the prompt
- Which visual track this prompt relates to
- The prompt in a copyable block of text
