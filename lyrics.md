# Voices of Defiance - Joan of Arc

**Style:** Early 2000s Emo Rock

---

**[Verse 1]**  
Sixteen with a secret burning through my mind  
They say I'm crazy but the silence isn't kind  
Of whispers only I can hear, of wars I have to win  
My mother cries at dinner while the voices call me in  

These visions bleed through daylight  
Make my hands shake at the seams  
But I'd rather die believing  
Than live inside their dreams  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
They dress me up in armor  
That was never meant to fit  
A girl who hears the angels  
Through the static and the grit  

**[Chorus]**  
I hear what you can't hear  
I'll fight what you won't dare  
Call me saint or call me liar  
I'm already burning here  

These voices in the static  
Say I'm more than just a name  
You can doubt my revelation  
But you'll never doubt my flame  

**[Instrumental Break - drums and bass only, 8 bars]**

**[Verse 2]**  
Leading boys to battle with their fathers' blood and fear  
They follow 'cause they think that God is whispering in my ear  
My armor weighs like prophecy, my faith tastes like gunpowder  
Every victory costs me something I can't say out louder  

At night I shake and wonder  
If I'm Joan or something worse  
The voices promise glory  
Without warning of the curse  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Tomorrow they'll betray me  
For the crime of being right  
A teenage girl who dared to think  
She'd bring them to the light  

**[Chorus]**  
I hear what you can't hear  
I'll fight what you won't dare  
Call me witch or call me warrior  
I'm already burning here  

These voices in the static  
Say I'm more than just a name  
You can doubt my revelation  
But you'll never doubt my flame  

**[Bridge]**  
They're stacking wood beneath me  
Like I'm something to forget  
But I've already been burning  
Since the moment that we met  
*(Those voices in my head)*  

**[Instrumental Build - minimal, rhythm section, building, 8 bars]**

The trial was just theater  
The verdict just a game  
You can kill the girl who heard them  
But you'll never kill my name  

**[Final Chorus]**  
I HEAR WHAT YOU CAN'T HEAR  
I'VE DONE WHAT YOU WON'T DARE  
Turn me into smoke and legend  
I'm already everywhere  

These voices in the static  
Made me more than just a name  
You can burn this body down  
But you'll NEVER TOUCH MY FLAME  

*(I'm already, I'm already burning)*  
You'll never touch my flame  

**[Outro]**  
Listen... can you hear them?  
The static's getting clear  
A thousand teenage prophets  
Who refuse to disappear  

*(The voices never leave us  
The voices never leave us  
The voices never...)*

## Orchestral Enhancement Notes:

- **Verse 1:** Sparse, intimate - solo cello underneath
- **Pre-Chorus:** Building tension - violas/cellos entering
- **Chorus:** Full strings + brass hits on "flame"
- **Verse 2:** Slightly fuller orchestration (battle imagery)
- **Bridge:** Strip down to solo instrument for vulnerability
- **Final Chorus:** FULL ORCHESTRA - strings soaring, brass punctuating, choir on "NEVER TOUCH MY FLAME"
- **Outro:** Ethereal choir layering on the fading "voices never leave us"
