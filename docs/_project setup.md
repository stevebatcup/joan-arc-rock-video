* Start brainstorming a narrative arc
* Write lyrics, structured around narrative arc and formatted for Suno
* Named characters and visual approach for them (Actors, etc)
* Update characters.md including details on hair and clothing
* Build character sheets using Midjourney / NanoBanana for each character
* Generate song on Suno and update narrative arc doc with sections if needed
* Decide on visual tracks
* Have AI rebuild these documents for the specific project:-
- lyrics
- narrative arc
- overview and workflow
- visual tracks
- image prompt builder
- README
* Generate prompt presets following the guidelines from the visual tracks and input into Sora
* Generate image/video prompts in batches of 15 following the narrative arc (+ the orchestral break section) output as JSON. Provide AI with the starting number each time and upload "image prompt builder" making sure it follows it to the letter.
e.g. song has 10 sections (plus 1 for orch) then: 11x15 = 165 images
* Import batches into app one at a time and begin generating in Sora using presets and character sheets where necessary
