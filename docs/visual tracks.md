**Building pre-chorus** → Warrior (armor, preparation) + Stage (band warming up)

**Explosive chorus** → All tracks intercut rapidly—fire, performance, battle, isolation

**Instrumental breaks** → Warrior + Stage (showcasing action/performance)

**Bridge** → Pyre-dominant (her transcendent moment)

**Final chorus** → Maximum intercut chaos—all four tracks bleeding together

## Visual Continuity Elements

**Joan's constant across all tracks:**
- Same actress (Zendaya) = visual anchor

- Physical presence—small but fierce

**Band members constant:**
