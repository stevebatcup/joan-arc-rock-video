# Comprehensive Sora Documentation and Best Practices Guide

## OpenAI Sora Model Overview and Capabilities

**Sora** is OpenAI's advanced text-to-video generation model that creates high-quality video content from textual descriptions. The latest version, **Sora 2**, represents a significant advancement over the original model with enhanced physics simulation, synchronized audio generation, improved steerability, and expanded stylistic range.

### Key Model Specifications

**Technical Capabilities:**
- **Maximum Duration**: Up to 20 seconds per clip (Sora 2), with some reports suggesting extensions to 30-60 seconds for certain use cases
- **Resolution**: Up to 1080p HD video output
- **Audio Generation**: Native synchronized audio including dialogue, sound effects, and ambient audio
- **Aspect Ratios**: Supports multiple formats including 16:9 widescreen, 9:16 vertical, and square formats
- **Frame Rate**: Standard video frame rates with enhanced temporal consistency

**Model Architecture:**
- Built on diffusion model technology similar to DALL-E, using transformer architecture for superior scaling performance
- Processes videos as collections of patches (similar to tokens in GPT models)
- Unified data representation enabling training on diverse durations, resolutions, and aspect ratios

## Prompting Style and Best Practices

### Fundamental Prompting Structure

The most effective Sora prompts follow a **cinematic shot list structure** with distinct components:

**1. Scene Setup**: Location, time, atmosphere, weather conditions
**2. Subject and Action**: Character details, specific actions, emotions, pacing
**3. Camera Grammar**: Shot type, angle, lens, movement, focus behavior
**4. Lighting and Color**: Light sources, directionality, mood, color palette
**5. Physics and Materials**: Surface textures, forces, interactions (wind, water, fabric)
**6. Audio Cues**: Ambient sounds, dialogue, sound effects
**7. Exclusions**: What you don't want to see (descriptive negation)

### Example High-Quality Prompt Structure

```
"A rainy neon alley in Tokyo at night; medium close-up on a courier adjusting their helmet; 35mm lens, shallow depth of field; handheld camera pushing in slowly; wet asphalt glistening with reflected neon pinks and blues; moody, synthwave color palette; ambient rain sounds mixing with distant traffic; no lens flare, maintain consistent color grading."
```

### Optimal Prompt Length and Complexity

**Research findings indicate:**
- **Prompts under 120 words** perform significantly better than longer ones
- **Simple prompts with 1-2 visual elements** achieve higher success rates
- **Concise, specific directions** lead to the most reliable results
- **Focused execution** is preferred over overwhelming complexity

### Cinematic Language Best Practices

**Camera Shots:**
- Close-up (CU), Medium shot, Wide shot, Over-the-shoulder (OTS)
- High angle, Low angle, Eye level, Bird's eye view, Dutch angle

**Camera Movements:**
- Pan, Tilt, Dolly, Truck, Crane/Jib, Zoom, Steadicam
- Arc, Roll, Whip pan, Handheld push-in

**Lens Specifications:**
- Wide angle (24mm), Standard (35mm), Portrait (85mm)
- Shallow depth of field, Deep focus, Bokeh effects

### Audio Integration Guidelines

**Effective Audio Prompting:**
- Specify dialogue with brief quotes: "One line of dialogue: 'Almost there.'"
- Layer ambient sounds: "Ambient rain; distant scooter idle"
- Describe audio-visual synchronization: "Footsteps matching character movement"
- Keep voice lines short for better lip-sync accuracy

## Content Restrictions and Prohibited Uses

### Primary Content Limitations

**Depictions of Real People:**
- Cannot create videos of real individuals without explicit consent
- **Cameo feature** requires opt-in verification and permission control
- Public figures cannot be generated unless they've uploaded cameos themselves
- **Likeness pilot** currently limited to select users for real person depictions

**Prohibited Content Categories:**
- **NSFW Content**: Non-consensual intimate imagery, adult sexual content
- **Violence**: Graphic violence, gore, content promoting terrorism
- **Harmful Content**: Self-harm promotion, eating disorder content, harassment
- **Misleading Content**: Deepfakes for fraud, impersonation, scams
- **Minor Protection**: Any sexualization of children, age-inappropriate content
- **Intellectual Property**: Copyrighted characters and content without permission

### Copyright and IP Restrictions

**Current Policy Changes:**
- OpenAI is transitioning from **opt-out to opt-in** approach for copyrighted characters
- Rights holders will receive "granular control over generation of characters"
- Disney and other major studios have already opted out of training data usage
- Revenue sharing with rights holders is being explored

### Safety Measures and Content Filtering

**Multi-layered Safety Stack:**
- **Input blocking**: Classifiers flag violating prompts before generation
- **Output blocking**: Post-generation review using CSAM classifiers and reasoning monitors
- **Increased safeguards for minors**: Stricter moderation for users under 18
- **C2PA metadata**: Industry-standard tamper-proof signatures embedded in all videos
- **Visible watermarking**: Moving watermarks on all generated content

## Technical Limitations and Model Weaknesses

### Known Performance Issues

**Physics and Spatial Understanding:**
- May struggle with complex physics simulations and cause-and-effect relationships
- Difficulty with precise spatial details (left vs. right orientation)
- Challenges with specific camera trajectory descriptions over time
- Objects may spontaneously appear or disappear, especially in crowded scenes

**Temporal Consistency Challenges:**
- **Sora 1 limitations**: Object permanence issues, physics inaccuracies
- **Sora 2 improvements**: Enhanced consistency but still not perfect for complex interactions

### Current Access and Availability Limitations

**Platform Availability:**
- **iOS app**: Available in US and Canada initially
- **Web interface**: sora.com with deeper controls
- **Android**: Planned for future release
- **Geographic restrictions**: UK, EU, Australia not included at launch

**Access Tiers:**
- **Sora 2**: Optimized for speed and everyday creation
- **Sora 2 Pro**: Higher fidelity for professional use (longer generation times)
- **Invite-only access**: Currently limited rollout with waitlist system

## Advanced Techniques and Optimization

### Iterative Refinement Strategy

**Version Control Approach:**
- Start with base prompt and iterate incrementally
- Change one variable at a time (lighting, camera angle, motion)
- Keep track of prompt versions and associated outputs
- Leverage community-driven prompt repositories and templates

### Multi-Shot Workflow Optimization

**Professional Production Pipeline:**
1. **Storyboard Planning**: Break 3-minute videos into 20-second segments
2. **Consistency Maintenance**: Use similar descriptive language across scenes
3. **Reference Linking**: Use final frames as image prompts for next scenes
4. **Post-Production Integration**: Assembly in editing software with transitions

### Style and Tone Optimization

**Successful Pattern Recognition:**
- **Whimsical and playful tones** perform well, especially for animals and humans
- **Simple, relatable scenarios** achieve higher success rates
- **Abstract or layered narratives** face challenges due to complexity
- **Neutral framing** avoids moderation issues with sensitive topics

### Quality Control Techniques

**Pre-Generation Planning:**
- Use **image prompts** alongside text for enhanced consistency
- Leverage **remix functionality** to iterate on successful generations
- Apply **descriptive negation** instead of relying on undocumented negative prompt features

**Post-Generation Refinement:**
- Generate multiple variations at lower resolution first
- Upscale and refine best candidates
- Combine clips using external editing software for longer sequences
