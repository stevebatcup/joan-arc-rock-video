# Joan of Arc Rock Video Project

## Overview

**Concept:** Create cinematic music videos that explore historical and literary figures through unexpected, anachronistic musical genres. Each video pairs a recognizable character with a genre that illuminates their emotional journey in fresh ways, enhanced with sophisticated orchestral arrangements.

**Example:** Joan of Arc through 90s/00s emo rock

**Core Innovation:** 
- Use AI-generated music (Suno) as foundation
- Add human compositional skill via orchestral enhancements
- Pair with AI-generated visuals using "actor as character" formula
- Create narrative through three distinct visual "tracks" or themes

**Differentiation:** This is NOT pure AI content. The orchestral arrangements, visual curation, narrative structure, and conceptual pairing are all human artistic choices that elevate AI-generated elements into cohesive artistic statements.
