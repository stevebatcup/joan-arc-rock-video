## How Tracks Intercut Based on Song Energy

**Quiet verses** → Origins (intimate) + Pyre (contemplative fire)

**Building pre-chorus** → Warrior (armor, preparation) + Stage (band warming up)

**Explosive chorus** → All tracks intercut rapidly—fire, performance, battle, isolation

**Instrumental breaks** → Warrior + Stage (showcasing action/performance)

**Bridge** → Pyre-dominant (her transcendent moment)

**Final chorus** → Maximum intercut chaos—all four tracks bleeding together

## Visual Continuity Elements

**Joan's constant across all tracks:**
- Same actress (Zendaya) = visual anchor
- Eyes—always intense, always hearing/seeing something more
- Defiant expression core to all contexts
- Physical presence—small but fierce

**Band members constant:**
- Same faces across all four tracks
- Different clothes/armor/instruments but recognizable
- Loyal presence in all contexts
- United energy whether peasants, warriors, or band

**Thematic visual threads:**
- Fire (literal in pyre, metaphorical in performance/battle)
- Light (divine in origins, stage lights, firelight)
- Smoke/atmosphere (battle, stage, pyre)
- Isolation vs. unity (Joan alone, Joan with her band)
